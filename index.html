        <h2>Introduction to Weather Prediction</h2>
        <p>Weather prediction involves using scientific methods and advanced technology to forecast atmospheric conditions. Accurate weather forecasts are essential for planning daily activities, agriculture, and disaster management.
            

1. Definition: Weather prediction, also known as weather forecasting, is the science of predicting atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place using various tools and techniques.

2. Importance: Weather forecasting helps people plan their daily activities, ensures safety during extreme weather events, and aids in sectors like agriculture, aviation, and disaster management.

3. Methods of Weather Prediction:
   - Observation: Meteorologists use weather stations, satellites, and radar to gather data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure.
   - Weather Models: Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models simulate the atmosphereâ€™s behavior using mathematical equations to predict future weather patterns.
   - Satellite Data: Satellites provide global observations of weather patterns, cloud movements, and changes in the atmosphere from space.
   - Radar: Radar systems detect precipitation, thunderstorms, and tornadoes by bouncing radio waves off particles in the air.

4. Challenges in Forecasting:
   - Complexity of the Atmosphere: The atmosphere is chaotic, making long-term predictions difficult.
   - Limited Data: In some regions, especially in developing countries or oceans, limited data can affect forecast accuracy.
   - Accuracy: Weather forecasts become less reliable as they extend further into the future (e.g., forecasts for a week or more are less precise).

5. Advancements: With improved technology, like AI and machine learning, weather prediction has become more accurate, helping to better anticipate severe weather events.</p>
